			<h2>Embracing Absurdism: Lessons from My Seven-and-Three-Quarter-Year-Old Nephew</h2>
			<p><br>Sometimes, amidst the chaos and confusion of adulthood, I find myself yearning for the simplicity and innocence of childhood. Ah, what a wonderful time it was, 
			devoid of worries about the future, fully immersed in the beauty of the present moment. Yet, to truly embrace childhood requires a level of awareness that, ironically, 
			eludes many adults. <br></br>
			I often pondered this thought as I watched my seven-and-three-quarter-year-old nephew, a bundle of boundless energy and curiosity, navigate the intricacies of life with remarkable 
			ease. It was during one of our conversations, where I attempted to impart some worldly wisdom upon him, that I was reminded of the absurdity of existence.<br></br>
			"Jack, come here a second" I began, "have you ever thought about how important it is to fully enjoy every moment of childhood? You know, because you might regret it later on?"<br></br>
			My nephew, in his characteristic fashion, squinted his eyes and furrowed his brow, as if contemplating the complexities of the universe. With a solemn nod, he declared, "I'm seven 
			and three quarters, you know. I've been on this planet for a long time, I already know everything you're telling me."<br></br>
			In that moment, I couldn't help but marvel at the absurdity of it all. Here I was, attempting to impart wisdom upon a child who, in his innocence, already possessed a profound 
			understanding of life's fleeting nature. It was as if he held the secrets of the universe in the palm of his hand, wrapped in the guise of a seven-year-old boy.
			Defeated but humbled, I retreated from our conversation, allowing my nephew to return to his world of Youtube and carefree laughter. As I observed him, I realized that there was 
			much more to learn from children than I had ever imagined.<br></br>
			In their unfiltered honesty and unwavering authenticity, children possess a wisdom that transcends age and experience. They see the world through untainted eyes, unburdened by the 
			complexities and contradictions that plague adulthood.<br></br>
			And so, I came to understand that perhaps my nephew was right all along. Life, to him, was as perfect as it could be, filled with simple pleasures and boundless joy. Who was I to 
			suggest otherwise?<br></br>
			As I reflect on our conversation, I am reminded of the words of the existentialist philosopher Albert Camus, who famously declared that the only truly serious philosophical question 
			is whether or not to commit suicide. In the face of life's inherent absurdity, perhaps the only rational response is to embrace it wholeheartedly, just as my nephew does, with laughter,
			love, and a never-ending supply of Strawberry Haribos.<br></br>
			In the end, maybe that's all we can do-embrace the absurdity of existence with the same fervor and enthusiasm as a seven-year-old boy, and trust that, despite its inherent chaos, 
			life is still worth living.</p>
