			<h2>Musings on the Absurdities of Existence</h2>
			<p>The universe is undeniably bizarre. From hot air balloons to berets, from beetles munching on poo to the enigmatic jiggle of jelly, it's a strange concoction indeed. 
			Even trivialities like the rubix cube and tomato juice (seriously, who needs tomato juice?) add to the peculiar tapestry of existence. And why do we persist in raiding the
			fridge multiple times, despite knowing full well there's nothing inside to satisfy our cravings? And where do forgotten thoughts go? These are the musings that occupy my mind 
			when I find myself seated on the porcelain throne, dreading the return to mundane reality.<br></br>
			Questions abound: What truly matters? Why do we matter? Why does anything matter at all? You might be thinking the same?<br></br>
			But alas, duty calls, urging me to abandon these philosophical ponderings in favor of more "pressing matters". Starting with the dismount from my porcelain perch, I embark 
			on a cascade of supposedly meaningful tasksâ€”tidying my bedroom, packing for tomorrow's escapades, tackling the mountain of dishes in the sink, meticulously folding clean 
			socks, indulging in a brief five-minute meme hunt as a self-proclaimed reward, and dutifully brushing my teeth.<br></br>
			Afterward, a hunger pang prompts the peeling and consumption of an orange, followed by yet another round of tooth-brushing. Procrastination, as always, beckons for another
			brief interlude, justified by the solemn proclamation of having "earned it once again". Then follows a whimsical two minutes and forty-three seconds of jumping up and down,
			a ritual born from the realization that life's moments are fleeting and unpredictable and therefore no one truly knows whenever they will last jump up and down.<br></br>
			In a moment of jest, I pose a hypothetical question to my significant other: "Would you still love me if I were a turtle?" The answer, however, stirs a blend of 
			amusement and resentment, leading to a whimsical debate on the nature of love and the whims of fate.<br></br>
			As the day draws to a close, I retire to bed, pondering the triviality of my actions and the paradox of documenting them before their execution. If this all seems
			 to you, rather absurd, and indeed it should, then ask yourself what really matters in life? Sure, there are magical moments in life but its the ordinary moments that occur ever day that
			make up what life truly is.<br></br> If you resonate with anything here then I urge you to head over to my 'Blogs' page, containing more of my absurd thoughts.</p>
